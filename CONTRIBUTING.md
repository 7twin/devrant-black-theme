# Issues (Bug Reports / Feature request / ..)

This repository has bug report and feature request templates setup, so please try to use them (you will be prompted during issue creation)

# Pull Requests

A good pull request includes:
- screenshots and description of the changes proposed
- if available a link to an opened issue
- only one fix or feature: each issue and feature should have their own PR
- a name tag addressing the person, most likely me: "@7twin"
